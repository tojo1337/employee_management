Employee management project.
A spring boot application which will probably be one of  the simplest.
It will only have a crud operation part for the admin and login/register part for the normal users. The normal users will also have a part where they could see their status like monthly income etc. It will be a simple project and it will work around the very basics of spring boot programming. Reset.html is not working for some reason. Need to fix it.
